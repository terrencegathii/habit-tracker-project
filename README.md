# Habit Tracker Project

## Project Overview
This project is a Habit Tracker designed to help you build and maintain healthy daily routines. By keeping track of your habits, you'll be able to see your progress over time and achieve your personal goals with more consistency.

### Project Goals:
- Provide a friendly interface to manage your habits.
- Help users track daily, weekly, or monthly routines.
- Visualize progress with streaks and charts.
- Foster productivity and better time management.

## How It Works

### Project Structure
- **Backend**: Handles data storage and processing, such as saving habits, tracking progress, and serving analytics. Integrations with a database (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB) ensure that user data is safely stored.
- **Frontend**: A user interface where users will interact with the app—for example, adding habits, marking progress, and viewing visualizations on streaks.
- **Documentation**: Contains setup guides, instructions, and references for contributors.

### Workflow Overview
1. **User Initialization**:
   Users sign up or log in to the application.

2. **Creating Habits**:
   Users can create new habits (e.g., "Read 20 pages daily") and assign goals to track them.

3. **Tracking Progress**:
   Users log updates by marking habits as complete (or skipped) each day. The backend securely processes and stores this data.

4. **Analytics and Feedback**:
   The app generates streaks, percentages, and charts (e.g., progress over weeks or months) using the stored data and displays them in the frontend.

### Example User Journey:
- Open the app on your browser.
- Add a habit like "Exercise for 30 minutes."
- Each day, check off the habit if completed.
- View your "streak stats," identifying trends like "10-day streak of exercising."
- Review visual summaries via charts.
